Choose a suitable food or beverage: For edibles, you can infuse marijuana into baked goods, candy, chocolate, or even beverages like tea or coffee. The choice of food or beverage will depend on your taste preferences and the desired effect.\n\n2. Decarboxylate the THC: THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana. Decarboxylation is a process that converts THCA (tetrahydrocanabinolic acid) into THC, making it more potent. You can decarboxylate the THC using a decarboxylation machine or by heating the marijuana at a low temperature (around 100\u00b0C) for 30-60 minutes.\n\n3.

You can use a precise measuring tool to ensure an even distribution of THC throughout the food or beverage.\n\n4. Dry and refrigerate: After adding THC to the food or beverage, it is important to let it dry for at least a few hours or even overnight.
